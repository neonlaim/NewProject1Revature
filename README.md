I created a Scala console application that retrieves Movie data using Apache Hive. This Scala CLI will consume data from an external API and will analyze the data with the objective of analyze  customer data and create watch recomendation by previous data.

Project 1 is a Scala console application that is retrieving data using Hive. 
This application allows users to view the trending topics in "movies"
- scrap data from datasets from movies DB
- query data to answer at least 6 analysis questions 
- have a login system for all users with passwords
- 2 types of users: BASIC and ADMIN
- Passwords must be encrypted
